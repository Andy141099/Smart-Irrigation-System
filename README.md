# Smart-Irrigation-System


INTRODUCTION:

The smart gardening kit is a system that allows controlling and automatic watering of a small plant.
We can collect data every day from the control panel to create a database to check up the growth of the plant.

What does it measure?

The moisture of the soil, this value will be directly used to decide whether to water or not to the plant.
The CO2 concentration. 
The intensity of the light.
The temperature and the humidity of ambient air.
The amount of water in the reservoir.

What action can be performed ?

A water pump will get water from a small reservoir to put it on the plant
A screen will display the information needed and 2 buttons to control what info to be displayed
A buzz will be triggered if the water level in the reservoir gets too low.
